# Advanced Keylogger with Secure Email Reporting
An all-in-one Python keylogger that logs keystrokes, captures clipboard data, gathers system info, and sends the logs via encrypted email attachments. For demonstration and legitimate monitoring only.

## Overview
This project implements a Python-based keylogger that:
- Captures keyboard input (using pynput).
- Monitors the clipboard (Windows only).
- Collects basic system info (OS, IP, etc.).
- Encrypts the logs using AES (Fernet) and optionally RSA.
- Emails the encrypted logs as attachments to a configured address.
Disclaimer: Intended for educational and legitimately permitted uses. Unauthorized usage may be illegal.

## Features
- Keylogging: Logs keystrokes in continuous intervals.
- Clipboard & System Info: Gathers clipboard text and system details.
- Encryption: Implements AES for file encryption, plus optional RSA-based double encryption for the AES key.
- Automatic Email: Sends logs over SMTP (Gmail by default) at each logging interval.
- Offline Caching: Queues logs for later if sending fails.
- Stealth Options: Minimizes console presence, can attempt registry-based startup on Windows.

## Installation & Setup
1.	Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/manavasnani/system-monitoring-keylogger.git
    cd system-monitoing-keylogger
2.	Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Configure Gmail (if applicable):
    Enable 2FA on your Google account.
    Create an App Password and use it instead of your normal Gmail password.
4.	Edit ****keylogger.py:
    Update EMAIL_SENDER, EMAIL_PASSWORD, EMAIL_RECIPIENT with your credentials.
    Adjust LOG_INTERVAL, RUN_AT_STARTUP, or RSA keys as you see fit.
________________________________________
## Usage
1.	Run the Script:
    python keylogger.py
2.	Type in Another Window:
    Switch to a text editor or web browser and type. The script wonâ€™t capture keystrokes typed into its own console on Windows.
    At each interval (or when you press ESC in that window), logs finalize.
3.	Check Logs & Email:
    A logs folder will contain raw and encrypted log files.
    Encrypted files (.enc) and the RSA-encrypted AES keys (.key) are emailed automatically.
4.	Stop the Script:
    Press Ctrl + C in the console to terminate the script.

## Configuration
- LOG_INTERVAL: Adjust how often logs rotate and are sent.
- RUN_AT_STARTUP: If True, attempts to add itself to Windows registry.
- SENSITIVE_KEYWORDS: Trigger extra logging or labeling for certain typed keywords.
- RSA Key Generation: Script auto-creates rsa_private.pem and rsa_public.pem unless found.

## Future Improvements
- Periodic screenshots or webcam snapshots (with explicit consent)
- GUI or web dashboard to control logging intervals
- Enhanced cross-platform compatibility for Linux/Mac
- Real-time remote management & on-demand log retrieval
